# Text Editor

Download Qt Creator : https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer

We created a basic text-editing application using Qt Creator. The application includes a QTextEdit widget for text input and QPushButton widgets for text formatting functionalities: Bold, Unbold, Superscript, Subscript, and an "About Me" section. The C++ code handles button clicks to apply the respective text formatting using QTextCursor and QTextCharFormat. The "About Me" button displays a dialog box with a resume-like summary. The UI design, defined in an XML file, sets up the layout and connects buttons to their corresponding actions, creating a functional text editor with basic formatting capabilities.

Major issues include limited formatting options, lack of undo/redo functionality, and no error handling or user feedback for actions.

Functionality Buttons : Bold , Unbold , Subscript , Superscript , About Me
